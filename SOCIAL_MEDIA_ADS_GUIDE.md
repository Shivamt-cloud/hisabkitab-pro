## 1. Choose the Right Platforms

| Platform | Best For | Audience | Cost (approx) |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Facebook / Meta Ads** | Small businesses, shop owners, India/global | 25–55, broad interests | ₹500–5,000/day to start |
| **Instagram** (via Meta) | Visual, mobile-first, younger business owners | Same as Facebook, visual feed | Same ad account as Facebook |
| **LinkedIn** | B2B, accountants, multi-location businesses | Professionals, companies | Higher CPM, ₹1,000+/day |
| **YouTube** (Google Ads) | Tutorials, demos, “how to manage inventory” | Intent-based, search + discovery | Pay per view or click |
| **Twitter/X** | Quick updates, tech-savvy SMBs | Niche, trending topics | Variable |

**Recommendation for HisabKitab-Pro:** Start with **Facebook + Instagram** (one Meta Ads account) for small shop owners and retailers in India; add **YouTube** for demo/tutorial ads later.

## 2. Set Clear Goals

- **Awareness:** “People should know HisabKitab-Pro exists.”
- **Traffic:** “People should visit our website / sign-up page.”
- **Leads / Sign-ups:** “People should register or start free trial.”
- **Sales:** “People should buy subscription / upgrade.”

For a SaaS product like yours, **Leads (sign-ups / trials)** or **Traffic** are usually the main objectives.

## 3. Step-by-Step: Running Ads (e.g. Meta – Facebook/Instagram)

### Step 1: Create a Meta Business Account

1. Go to [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com).
2. Create a **Business Account** and add your **Business Page** (create one for HisabKitab-Pro if you don’t have it).
3. In **Business Settings**, add **Ad Accounts** and (optional) **Instagram** account.

### Step 2: Install Meta Pixel (Optional but Recommended)

1. In **Events Manager**, create a **Pixel** and link it to your ad account.
2. Add the Pixel code to your **website / app landing page** (e.g. sign-up page, pricing page).
3. Use **Meta Pixel Helper** (Chrome extension) to verify it fires on page load and on key actions (e.g. “CompleteRegistration”).

This helps Meta:
- Track visits and sign-ups from your ads.
- Optimize for “conversions” (e.g. sign-up, purchase).
- Build “Custom Audiences” (e.g. people who visited but didn’t sign up) for retargeting.

### Step 3: Create a Campaign

1. In **Meta Business Suite** → **Ads Manager** → **Create**.
2. Choose objective, e.g. **Leads** or **Traffic**.
3. Name the campaign (e.g. “HisabKitab-Pro – Sign-ups Q1”).

### Step 4: Set Up Ad Set (Targeting & Budget)

- **Audience:**
  - Location: India (or states/cities where you want to focus).
  - Age: 25–55 (business owners / managers).
  - Interests: Small business, retail, inventory, accounting, GST, entrepreneurship, Shopify, etc.
  - Behaviors: Small business owners, page admins (optional).
- **Placements:** Start with **Automatic** (Facebook + Instagram); later you can test Instagram-only or Facebook-only.
- **Budget:** Daily or lifetime. Start small (e.g. ₹500–1,000/day); increase if results are good.
- **Schedule:** Always on or specific days/hours.
- **Optimization:** For “Leads” choose “Lead form submissions” or “Conversions”; for “Traffic” choose “Link clicks” or “Landing page views.”

### Step 5: Create the Ad Creative

- **Format:** Single image, carousel (multiple screens/features), or short video (15–30 s).
- **Copy:**
  - Headline: e.g. “Inventory & Billing Made Simple – Try HisabKitab-Pro.”
  - Primary text: Problem (manual stock, GST, multi-device) → Solution (one app, cloud sync, 1 device + 1 mobile plan).
  - Call to action: “Sign Up,” “Learn More,” “Start Free Trial.”
- **Visual:** App screenshot, dashboard, or short screen recording; add logo and clear text overlay (e.g. “GST-Ready • Cloud Backup • 1 device + 1 mobile”).
- **Destination:** Your sign-up URL or a lead form (Meta’s “Instant Form”) that collects name, phone, email and then sends them to your site.

### Step 6: Launch and Monitor

- Run the campaign for at least 5–7 days before judging.
- Check **Ads Manager** for: spend, link clicks, landing page views, leads/sign-ups, cost per lead (CPL).
- Pause underperforming ad sets/ads; scale the ones with lower CPL and good sign-up rate.

## 4. Content Ideas for Ads

- **Problem–solution:** “Tired of manual stock registers? Manage inventory & GST in one app.”
- **Feature highlight:** “1 device + 1 mobile plan – run your shop from phone and computer.”
- **Social proof:** “Used by 500+ retailers” (if true) or “Trusted by small businesses.”
- **Offer:** “Start free trial” or “First month at 50% off” (if you have such offers).
- **Demo:** Short screen recording of creating a sale, viewing report, or cloud backup.

Use these in both **image/carousel** and **video** ads.

---

## 5. Budget and Expectations

- **Starter:** ₹500–1,500/day on Meta (Facebook + Instagram). Expect 50–200 link clicks and a few to 10+ sign-ups per day depending on targeting and creative.
- **Scaling:** If CPL is acceptable, increase budget by 15–20% every few days on winning ad sets.
- **Retargeting:** Create a Custom Audience of “Website visitors last 30 days” and run a separate ad set with a stronger offer (e.g. “Complete your sign-up – 20% off first year”). Usually lower CPL than cold audience.

---

## 6. Do’s and Don’ts

**Do:**

- Use a clear landing page (e.g. `/signup` or `/pricing`) and match ad message to that page.
- Test 2–3 different images/videos and 2–3 headlines per campaign.
- Track sign-ups (e.g. Meta Pixel “CompleteRegistration” or UTM parameters + your backend).
- Start with one country (e.g. India) and one language before expanding.

**Don’t:**

- Use misleading claims (“Free forever” if it’s limited trial).
- Send traffic to a generic homepage with no clear “Sign up” or “Try free” CTA.
- Change budget or targeting too often (give algorithms 5–7 days to optimize).

---

## 7. Other Channels (Short)

- **Google Ads (Search):** Run ads on keywords like “inventory management software India,” “GST billing app for shop.” Good for high intent; usually higher cost per click, good for conversions.
- **YouTube:** Skippable in-stream ads on “inventory,” “billing,” “GST for business” videos; or Discovery ads. Use a 15–30 s product demo.
- **LinkedIn:** Use for “business owners,” “retail managers,” “accountants.” Best for B2B; costlier, use when you target companies or professionals.

## 8. Quick Checklist Before Going Live

- [ ] Business page and ad account set up (e.g. Meta).
- [ ] Landing page live with clear CTA (Sign up / Start trial).
- [ ] Pixel or conversion tracking installed and tested.
- [ ] 2–3 ad creatives (image or video) ready.
- [ ] Target audience defined (location, age, interests).
- [ ] Daily budget and campaign end date set.
- [ ] UTM parameters on links (e.g. `?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid`) so you can see which platform/ad brings sign-ups.

If you share your current sign-up URL and whether you use a free trial or direct paid sign-up, the campaign structure (e.g. “Leads” vs “Traffic”) and ad copy can be tailored even more closely to HisabKitab-Pro.
