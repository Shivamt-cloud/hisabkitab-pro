# App Icons

You need to create the following icon files in this directory:

1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels

For now, you can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons.
The icons should represent your app (HisabKitab-Pro).

Alternatively, you can use a placeholder image for now and replace it later.

To create icons quickly:
- Use an online tool like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Make sure the icons are square and the specified sizes

The PWA will work even with placeholder icons, but custom icons look more professional.
